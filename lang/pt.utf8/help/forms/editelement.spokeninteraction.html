<ul>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('spokenInteraction','a1')">A1</a>: I can interact in a simple way provided the other person is prepared to repeat or rephrase things at a slower rate of speech and help me formulate what I'm trying to say. I can ask and answer simple questions in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('spokenInteraction','a2')">A2</a>: I can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar topics and activities. I can handle very short social exchanges, even though I can't usually understand enough to keep the conversation going myself.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('spokenInteraction','b1')">B1</a>: I can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken. I can enter unprepared into conversation on topics that are familiar, of personal interest or pertinent to everyday life (e.g. family, hobbies, work, travel and current events).
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('spokenInteraction','b2')">B2</a>: I can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible. I can take an active part in discussion in familiar contexts, accounting for and sustaining my views.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('spokenInteraction','c1')">C1</a>: I can express myself fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions. I can use language flexibly and effectively for social and professional purposes. I can formulate ideas and opinions with precision and relate my contribution skilfully to those of other speakers.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('spokenInteraction','c2')">C2</a>: I can take part effortlessly in any conversation or discussion and have a good familiarity with idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms. I can express myself fluently and convey finer shades of meaning precisely. If I do have a problem I can backtrack and restructure around the difficulty so smoothly that other people are hardly aware of it.
