<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('reading','a1')">A1</a>: I can understand familiar names, words and very simple sentences, for example on notices and posters or in catalogues.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('reading','a2')">A2</a>: I can read very short, simple texts. I can find specific, predictable information in simple everyday material such as advertisements, prospectuses, menus and timetables and I can understand short simple personal letters.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('reading','b1')">B1</a>: I can understand texts that consist mainly of high frequency everyday or job-related language. I can understand the description of events, feelings and wishes in personal letters.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('reading','b2')">B2</a>: I can read articles and reports concerned with contemporary problems in which the writers adopt particular attitudes or viewpoints. I can understand contemporary literary prose.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('reading','c1')">C1</a>: I can understand long and complex factual and literary texts, appreciating distinctions of style. I can understand specialised articles and longer technical instructions, even when they do not relate to my field.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('reading','c2')">C2</a>: I can read with ease virtually all forms of the written language, including abstract, structurally or linguistically complex texts such as manuals, specialised articles and literary works.
