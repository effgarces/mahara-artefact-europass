<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('listening','a1')">A1</a>: I can understand familiar words and very basic phrases concerning myself, my family and immediate surroundings when people speak slowly and clearly.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('listening','a2')">A2</a>: I can understand phrases and the highest frequency vocabulary related to areas of most immediate personal relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local area, employment). I can catch the main points in short, clear, simple messages and announcements.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('listening','b1')">B1</a>: I can understand the main points of clear standard speech on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc. I can understand the main points of many radio or TV programmes on current affairs or topics of personal or professional interest when the delivery is relatively slow and clear.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('listening','b2')">B2</a>: I can understand extended speech and lectures and follow even complex lines of argument provided the topic is reasonably familiar. I can understand most TV news and current affairs programmes. I can understand the majority of films in standard dialect.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('listening','c1')">C1</a>: I can understand extended speech even when it is not clearly structured and when relationships are only implied and not signalled explicitly. I can understand television programmes and films without too much effort.
</li>
<li><a href="#" onclick="setLevel('listening','c2')">C2</a>: I have no difficulty in understanding any kind of spoken language, whether live or broadcast, even when delivered at fast native speed, provided I have some time to get familiar with the accent.
